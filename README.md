The repository includes the code of BS-STN and the sliding bearing dataset collected by Chongqing University.
The training codes and demos of BS-STN will be released after the acceptance of the paper "Bi-structural spatial-temporal network for few-shot fault
diagnosis of rotating machinery", which is submitted to the journal: Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing.
